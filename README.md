## 🎥 What Is EarthLive.TV?

EarthLive.TV is building the world’s largest *real-time* map of Earth through livestreams.  
We index and organise thousands of live cameras across **272+ countries, regions, and territories**, covering:

- 🦒 Wildlife & Nature  
- 🏖 Beaches & Coastlines  
- ✈ Airports & Flight Viewpoints  
- 🌆 Cities & Landmarks  
- 🚁 Aerial & Drone Livecams  
- 🌋 Volcano & Weather Cams  
- 🚦 Roads, Traffic & Public Spaces  
- ⚓ Ports, Harbours & Islands  

Every camera is checked automatically using the YouTube Data API and refreshed daily to ensure viewers always see cameras that are **actually live** — not offline.
